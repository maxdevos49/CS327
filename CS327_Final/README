This program is a Scene based Game library written in c++ to render scenes with ncurses. Each scene has a 
create, update, and render method. These methods are called by the scene manager that controls the flow of
the game. Scenes can be run 1 at a time or in parallel. 

Controls
--------
Switch scenes press 's'
Pause scene press 'p'
Quit press 'q'

Other
-----
The game library is in the lib folder. Everything outside of the lib folder is code using the library to 
create pacman.
