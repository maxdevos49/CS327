## COM S 327: Advanced Programming Techniques
---

All of my homework from taking CS327 during the spring of 2019. During this class we built a dungeon crawler over the course of ~9 weeks and then a final project of our choice with significant complexity.

Folder Naming:
1. Week*(Week1, Week2, ...etc) - My notes/or examples that were shown in class.
   
2. hw*_**(hw1_01, hw1_02, ...etc) - My implementation of that weeks assignment. I would start the next week by pulling in partial changes of the professors solution that I thought would improve maintainability or reduce complexity.
   
3. s_hw*_**(s_hw1_01, s_hw1_02, ...etc)) - The professors solution for a weeks assignment. This code was not written by me but by my professor so all students could have a starting point for the next week if they choose not to continue there own implementation.

4. CS327_Final - Homework 2 or the final project for the class. The assignment only requirement was that it had significant complexity. I created a scene manager system with the ability to draw multiple layers of a scene onto the console.
