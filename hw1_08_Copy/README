About
-----
This project is a dungeon crawler being developed in c++ for CS327. Current functionality 
includes generating a dungeon with connecting corridors and then drawing it to a terminal. 
It also supports saving and loading files from its default save directory or from its 
working directory if that location was not found. The game is now playable using the vim
movement layout provided in the current assignment spec. It also includes a monster list
that can be accessed with 'm' and closed with the escape key. Cheats are included now with 
'f' to toggle the fog and 't' to teleport.
